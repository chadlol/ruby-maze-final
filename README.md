Write a Ruby program which will solve a simple maze which will be provided. This must utilize a Maze class that you create. Inside your class, you will need to:
1.	Read the maze into memory into some structure for processing â€“ DOUBLE ARRAY
2.	Print out the maze before it is solved
3.	Solve the maze by printing a character "path" from the beginning to the end which is specified by S (start) and F (finish).
4.	Print the final maze with the path shown
5.	IF there is no solution, then print an appropriate message and quit
There are 10 mazes provided called "maze1.mz" through "maze10.mz" which you can use to test your solution.
Your main program should show a menu to the user to allow them to select a particular maze to solve.
